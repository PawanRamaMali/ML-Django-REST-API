# ML-Django-REST-API


### To deploy the model we have trained via an API, we have to structure our API to:

* Accept data and pre-process it
* Load the model we have trained using pickle
* Predict the outcome based on the data we have passed
* Return the prediction and confidence score as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
